#  MiniGolf VR

As a school project, we created a virtual reality game using Unity. The game is intended for the Occulus Quest, and has only be tested on it.

## Description

The player is immersed in a field containing 3 mini-golf courses, and some vegetation. Once equipped with the golf club, the player can go hit the ball and overcome the obstacles. 

At the begining of the game, a golf club is available on the left. To make a stroke, the player simply adjust the power of the club, point the ball in the desired direction and then hit the ball with the club.

The first course is a simple angle, the second one contains a jump with a springboard, and for the third course, the ball has to pass through a windmill without touching the wings. When the player makes a successful stroke, the ball is automatically teleported to the next course. 

Cubes are positioned on all courses and increase the score if they are hit by the ball.
